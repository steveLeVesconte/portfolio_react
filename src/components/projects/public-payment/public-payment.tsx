        <ul>
          <li>Online public portal allows customers (licensees and companies) to search for and pay their invoices
            online.</li>
          <li>This system is used by Licensed Nursing Home Administrators, Nursing Home companies and Continuing
            Education Course Providers.</li>
          <li>Users can search for their invoices by multiple criteria.</li>
          <li>Users can see the status of their invoices (paid or not) and optionally pay them online with either
            major credit card or checking account.</li>
          <li>The system needs no user authentication because all of the invoices are classed as “public records”
            and so require no security.</li>

      <p>Before this system was in place, the various sub-departments of the Ohio Department of Aging process thousands of paper checks per quarter.  Many were misrouted and or lost because the payees did not provide adequate information to attribute each check to the right account.  This resulted in large amounts of staff time being expended on finding and applying checks where account information was missing.  </p>



<p>The online  payment system achieved 90% participation resulting in large savings of staff time in processing checks and in answering inquiries from consumers about the status of their invoices.</p>

<p>Technologies: MVC, C#, Oracle, jQuery, WCF.</p>
